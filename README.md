# 📘 AI Teacher – Local LLM Built From Scratch (No API)

AI Teacher is a locally built Large Language Model (LLM) designed to work as a personal teacher.
This project is developed completely from scratch using PyTorch, trained on custom data, and runs fully offline without using any external APIs such as OpenAI or Gemini.

The purpose of this project is to understand how Large Language Models work internally and to build an educational AI system step by step.
